### js-dev-console javascript console written in javascript - created with Stencil.js

js-dev-console was written to enable mobile app debugging - on the device itself - in production mode.

While deploying ionic based apps in production mode to beta testers we ran into the problem of not beeing able to reproduce some of the bugs they reported. 

So I wrote js-dev-console to be able to inspect whats going wrong.

### Preview at https://farbdose.github.io/js-dev-console/

### Features

* live view of mutating javascript objects
* autocompletion
* default trigger: rotate the device 5 times with exactly 5 seconds inbetween.
